 Aplication windows Forms .NET Framework C#  developed in college to learn the menu concept

 CHALLENGE 01 – Create a single application with multiple forms (Forms)

A contractor requests the creation of an application for calculations that allows making 3
different calculations.
The same wants it to be a single program that has a main screen and a menu
to call up the other screens (one for each calculation). In this way the application will have 4
forms and will use a Menu component to create a way for the user to access
each of the calculation options.
Below are the calculations that must be performed in each form:

1) A thermistor is a device whose resistance varies as a function of temperature. For
a certain NTC thermistor, the manufacturer specifies that the temperature can be obtained
in degrees Celsius from the resistance presented through the following equation:

TC =

1

298.15−1 + 3950−1 ∗ log R
10000
− 273.15

Create a form that requests the resistance value presented by 3 thermistors and
which, using the formula above, converts the given resistances into the respective
temperatures in degrees Celsius.
Some examples of values ​​that can be used to validate that the calculation is
correct can be seen in the list below:
• 1000 ohms = 49.34°C
• 10000 ohms = 25°C

• 12100 ohms = 23.15°C
• 15395 ohms = 20.85°C

• 100000 ohms = 4.07°C

2) Build a form to help convert a velocity from m/s to
km/s and vice versa. The algorithm must request the operation that the user wants to do, and then
then do the conversion using the equations below.
speedm/s =

speedkm/h
3.6

speedkm/s = speedm/s ∗ 3.6
3) The company responsible for supplying water to a city charges its
consumers as follows:

The. A service fee of R$28.50 is charged. Within this cost,
the customer has the right to consume up to 8,000 liters of water per month.
B. If consumption exceeds 8,000 liters, an additional amount is charged
of R$0.00854 for each extra liter.

Create a form that requests the amount of liters consumed by this customer and that
calculate the amount to be paid.
